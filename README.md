# Trivia_Game

This is a two player Python Trivia Game that is played in the terminal of your preferred IDE. Users can pick between four categories and easy or hard questions. 
Once the users pick their category and difficulty level, they will play through five questions. Once they finish the last question, they can choose to keep playing or quit. If the users choose to quit, they will see their score at the end and who the winner is. If the users choose to continue, they will be prompted to pick another category and difficulty level of questions.
